<h4>Inspiration</h4>
We wanted to make a web site, with our domain: <a href = helloworldhack.com/> helloworldhack.com </a>.
We were initially inspired by the Reddit post, with the collaborative pixel art canvas timelapse, and wanted to make our own version.

<h4>Background</h4>
That all started on April Fools' Day 2017, in which a 
social experiment was launched in the form of a subreddit called "place". It featured a collaborative 
pixel art canvas, where a user could place a pixel every five minutes. The whole process was captured 
as a full 72 hours (90fps) timelapse.

<h4>Improvements</h4>
This is an ongoing project. We are wanting to add new features and maintain this website. We would like to incorpoate a 
timeline to give the option to go back and view the timelapse. We may incorporate a colour wheel to 
increase user functionality.
